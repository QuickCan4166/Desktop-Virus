# Goose-Virus
A Desktop Goose mod that adds fake-virus style visual effects (no destructive behavior).

## What it does
- Adds red flicker/glitch lines when the goose is "mad".
- Temporarily swaps your wallpaper to a fake warning screen.
- Restores wallpaper automatically when the goose calms down.
- Press **ESC** at any time to restore wallpaper and exit immediately.

## How to run it
1. Build the mod from `DesktopGoose v0.31/FOR MOD-MAKERS/GooseMod_DefaultSolution`.
2. Copy the compiled `DefaultMod.dll` into your Desktop Goose mods folder.
3. Start Desktop Goose normally.

## How to make the goose "mad"
The virus effects trigger when the goose is in aggressive behavior, or you can provoke it manually:
- Click near the goose **3 times quickly** (within a couple of seconds).
- That starts a short fake-virus burst (about 9 seconds).

Nothing in this mod deletes files or makes permanent system changes.
